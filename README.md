# snake-game

This project is a Simple Snake game for the Software Engineering course of University of Debrecen. I chose to do Snake because I have always played it when I was a child, and I thought this would be a great and challenging topic to make. 
# Use
To play the game you have to clone it to your computer then:  
 ~ give out 'mvn clean install' and 'mvn exec:java' command  
 or  
~ run the JAR file generated in the project

# Have fun playing ! :)
